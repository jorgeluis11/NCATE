  <p style = " text-indent: 1em; width:900px;   text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px;margin-top: 10px;">The conceptual framework of the Teacher Preparation Program at UPRB is in alignment with the mission and vision of the institution (UPRB) and with that of the University of Puerto Rico system. The core principles of the TPP-UPRB are embedded in the conceptual framework and are based on a vision of the teacher as an intellectual, education as a reflective practice, and the acknowledgement of diversity in education for the achievement of social justice.</p>

    As intellectual teachers, our graduates are expected to have a deep understanding of the knowledge base of the disciplines, to pose questions, and seek ways to solve problems. As transformative intellectuals, they are expected to become advocates for children, their families, their profession, and society. Educators transform the educational experience when they participate in a reflective process concerning their duties and their performance as a teacher. Such processes require teachers to confront the complexities of students and their learning, their own and that of their teaching, that of the subject matter and of the context within which the aforementioned elements operate. Further, candidates acknowledge diversity by understanding issues related to equity, diversity, and inclusion; and their relationship with an education founded on social justice.

    Consistent with the unit conceptual framework, candidates are expected to explore the structure of the disciplines, the social and cultural nature of learning and teaching, and the application of theory to practice in order to explain instructional decisions and advocacy processes as a means of participating and of promoting transformation and social justice. The proficiencies or competencies that the teacher candidates of the TPP-UPRB are expected to achieve are rigorously aligned with institutional, state, and professional standards.

    Rooted in its vision and mission, the fundamental principles of its philosophy and knowledge base, TPP-UPRB encourages its graduates to aspire to be competent professionals, effective in their educational practices with a strong critical and ethical sense. The program hopes to develop intellectual educators, capable of transforming their practice as a product of reflection; conscious of the importance of learning that takes into consideration cognitive, affective, cultural and social aspects. To accomplish this, the program establishes proficiencies that it hopes the candidates will achieve. The proficiencies are aligned with the professional standards and principles of the following accreditation and state agencies:
  </p>
  <ul style= "width:900px;   text-align: justify; margin-left: 120px;margin-top: 10px;">
    <li>National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE)</li>
    <li>  Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC)</li>
    <li>Consejo de Educaci√≥n Superior de Puerto Rico (Higher Education Council of Puerto Rico) (CES).</li>
  </ul>
  <p style= "text-indent: 1em; width:900px;   text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px;margin-top: 10px; text-indent: 1em;">They are also aligned with the standards of the following professional organizations that provide national recognition through their rigorous self-study processes:
  </p>
  <ul style= "width:900px;   text-align: justify; margin-left: 120px;margin-top: 10px;">
    <li>Association for Childhood Education International (ACEI)</li>
    <li> National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)</li>
    <li> National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE)</li>
  </ul>
  <p style= "text-indent: 1em; width:900px;   text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px;margin-top: 10px;">The proficiencies have a direct relationship and connection to three fundamental principles of TPPUPRB: reflective practice, recognition of diversity in learning to promote social justice, and the vision of the teacher as an intellectual. All this supports the formation of reflective teachers capable of transforming their educational practice.
    The TPP-UPRB conceptual framework was developed during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 academic years. It involved professional discussions related to philosophies, educational and social theories underpinning each of the two programs that comprise the TPP-UPRB. As part of the ongoing assessment process it is expected to be revised before the next reaccreditation visit in Fall 2014.
