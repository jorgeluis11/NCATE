        <p>The purpose of the PPM-UPRB is to implement a high quality undergraduate program to develop teacher candidates with the competencies, dispositions, knowledge, and skills to become intellectual, competent, ethical, creative, and self-reflective professionals capable of working with the appropriate pedagogic practices to respond to the challenges and demands of our times. The intent is to develop an educator who is a leader, who can create effective learning communities open to diversity, and who, at the same time, provides support for social reconstruction.

        <p>
         The TTP-UPRB began with a socio-cultural conception of knowledge as a philosophical foundation. It visualized solving problems from the reflective and critical point of view, serving as the central axis of the educational process. The relationship between learning and teaching is dual, of dialogic nature where the educator acts as a tool for social change. The learning process is conceptualized as a construction of knowledge manifested through an explorative and investigative process occurring in a dynamic way, paying attention to diversity. It eliminates all of the effects brought upon by psychological, physical, ecological barriers, to promote the goal of social reconstruction.
  Candidates are encouraged to develop the necessary skills and attitudes for the creation of a community that is inclusive, equal, critical, literal, and participatory. General and professional content is utilized as a useful knowledge base in the formation of the candidate, in such way that he/she may contribute through positions of leadership to transform society.
