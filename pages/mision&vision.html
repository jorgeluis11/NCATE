        <p>
          The TTP-UPRB is a diverse active learning community. It facilitates the development of intellectual candidates committed to social justice from a social-humanistic perspective. The program perceives educators as lifelong learners, changing and transforming their practice, with a high sense of selfdirection and respect for knowledge, as well as social and cultural diversity. It is hoped graduates from these programs become protagonists in the process of democratic and constant educational reform of this country, in addition to their own educational practice.
